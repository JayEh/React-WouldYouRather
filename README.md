# Project 2: Would You Rather.. ?

This project is a requirement of the React Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity. As a game, users will sign into the app and answer questions that have been submitted by other users. The game tracks who submitted which questions, and how many questions each user has answered. Users can track their scores by checking out the leader board.

The Would You Rather project utilizes React to render UI elements and Redux to manage UI state. There is a mock web API that the application talks to as its data source.

After launching the app, the user is presented with a login page and asked to login before proceeding. Once logged in the app will display the home page, defaulting to a list of unanswered questions.

    The home page allows the user to toggle back and forth between answered and unanswered

Users are also able to add new questions for others to answer, and check the leaderboard to see who has the most points.

    When the user is done they click Logout to end the session
